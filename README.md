🧮 DAX Measures & Calculated KPIs
(Using Power BI DAX Engine for deriving custom business insights)

Net Sales = SUM(Net Sales)

Total Quantity = SUM(Quantity)

Net Average Order Value = [Net Sales] / [Total Quantity]

Repeat Rate = Repeat Customers / Total Customers

Purchase Frequency = Total Orders / Total Customers

Life Time Value = Net Sales / Total Customers

These calculations helped segment the customer base and quantify retention and purchasing behavior effectively. ✅
